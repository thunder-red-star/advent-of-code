# Advent of Code 2022
This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

> **Warning**
> I'm too lazy to post updates to GitHub so you can consider this [Advent of Code](https://github.com/thunder-red-star/advent-of-code/) to be a [Ramadan of Code](https://github.com/thunder-red-star/ramadan-of-code), even though it's a few months early. I will update rankings but not code.

> **Note**  
> This code is cleaned up and commented for the purpose of sharing with others. This isn't the original code I wrote! Please try solving the problems yourself first before referring to my solutions.

## Usage
Each folder (01 to 25) contains a `main.py` file that can be run with Python 3.9. The input for each challenge is stored in a `input.txt` file.

There is also a `fetcher.py` file that fetches inputs for a given day at 12:00 that day, and initializes `main.py` and `input.txt` files for that day.

## My rankings

| Day     | Part 1 Rank  | Part 2 Rank |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| 1       | 127954       | 122958      |
| 2       | 4282         | 1535        | 
| 3       | 43           | 1241        |
| 4       | 208          | 285         |
| 5       | 1816         | 1217        |
| 6       | 250          | 198         |
| 7       | 535          | 252         |
| 8       | 64811        | 58068       |

> **Warning**  
> Please don't be sad if you don't get a high ranking. I'm not a professional programmer, and I'm sure there are many people who are much better than me. I'm just doing this for fun! There's always another year to try again.
