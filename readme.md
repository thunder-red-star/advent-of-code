# Advent of Code 2022
This repository contains my solutions (cleaned up and with helpful comments) to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

> **Warning**  
> This code is cleaned up and commented for the purpose of sharing with others. This isn't the original code I wrote! Please try solving the problems yourself first before referring to my solutions.

## Usage
Each folder (01 to 25) contains a `main.py` file that can be run with Python 3.9. The input for each challenge is stored in a `input.txt` file.

There is also a `fetcher.py` file that fetches inputs for a given day at 12:00 that day, and initializes `main.py` and `input.txt` files for that day.
